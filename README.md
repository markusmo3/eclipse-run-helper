# Eclipse Run Helper

Your Eclipse run history or favorites, from the keyboard

## What does it do?

It gives you easy keyboard-driven access to the last few things you ran.

## Great. How do I install it?

Just grab the plug-in [here](https://github.com/markusmo3/eclipse-run-helper/releases/download/1.1.0/uk.co.sinjakli.eclipserunhelper_1.1.0.jar) and put it in the dropins folder of your Eclipse installation.

## How do I use it?

* Ctrl + Shift + F11 -> Run Favorites
* Shift + F11 -> Debug Favorites
* Ctrl + Shift + Alt + F11 -> Run History
* Shift + Alt + F11 -> Debug History

* A number from 1 to 9 to select an item from your history
* The letter "t" to re-run your last (JUnit) test run

## I've got a problem. Help!

If you've found a potential bug, or would like to request a feature then the best place is [the issue tracker](https://github.com/Sinjo/eclipse-run-helper/issues). If you want to discuss something then feel free to send me a message.

## What's next?

I've got a few ideas for what I'd like to add, probably in this order:

* Restart web server (Tomcat/Jetty/other)
* Open run/debug configuration dialogs
* User defined keybindings to specific launch configurations
